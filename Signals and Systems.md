# Signals
Signals are typically used to transmit information and can be either continous or discrete.

## Analog Signals
A continous signal that can take any value in a range.

## Discrete Signals
Discrete signals are defined only at specific time intervals, with values at discrete points. They are discrete in time and continous in amplitude.

## Digital Signals
A digital signal that represents values using binary numbers.
