# Signals
Signals are typically used to transmit information and can be either continous or discrete. 

#### Characteristics of Signals
- **Amplitude:** The magnitude of the signal at any point.
- **Frequency:** How often the signal oscillates or repeats within a given time.
- **Phase:** The relative position of the waveform with respect to time.
- **Energy and Power:** Measures of the strength or intensity of the signal.

## Analog Signals
Analog signals are conitnous in both time and amplitude, they can take any value within a given range and are represented as a smooth wave.

Examples:
- Human voice
- Voltage in electrical circuit
- Temperature

## Discrete Signals
Discrete signals are defined only at specific time intervals, with values at discrete points. They are discrete in time and continous in amplitude.

Examples:
- Daily Stock prices
- Digital Clock

## Digital Signals
Digital signals are discrete in both time and amplitude, typically represented as binary values (0 and 1).

Examples:
- Data transmitted in computer networks
- Audio files (MP3, WAV)
- Images in digital format

# Systems
A system processes input signals to produce output signals.

1. **Linear Systems:** A system is linear if it satisfies the principles of superposition (additivity and homogeneity)
2. **Time-Invariant Systems:** A system is time-invariant if its behavior and characteristics do not change over time.
3. **Realizable Systems:** A system is realizable if it can be physically implemented, must have a causal structure, where the output depends only on the current and past inputs, not future inputs.
4. **Stable Systems:** A system is stable if bounded input signals always produce bounded output signals (BIBO stability).
