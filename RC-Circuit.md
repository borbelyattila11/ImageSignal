# RC Circuit
An RC Circuit (Resistor-Capacitor circuit) is an analog circuit consisting of a resistor (R) and a capacitor (C).

1. **Low-Pass RC Circuit:** Allows low-frequency signals to pass through attenuating higher frequencies.
   - Transfer Function:
     $H(s) = \frac{1}{1 + sRC}$
2. **High-Pass RC Circuit:** Allows high-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating lower frequencies.
   - Transfer Function:
     $H(s) = \frac{sRC}{1 + sRC}$
3. **Cutoff Frequency:** The frequency at which the signal's power drops to half of its passband value.
   - Defined as:
     $f_c = \frac{1}{2Ï€RC}$
