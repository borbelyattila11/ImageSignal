# Filtering in Frequency Domain
Refers to the process of modifying an image's frequency components in order to enhance or suppress certain aspects. Often used to improve image quality by removing unwanted noise or emphasizing specific features.

## The General Model
Transforming the image from spatial domain (pixel values) to frequency domain (sinusoidal patterns) using Fourier Transform. In the frequency domain the image is represented by spectrum and phase.

## Fourier-Transform of images
The Fourier Transform decomposes the image into a sum of sine and cosine waves, each with specific frequencies and amplitudes. In case of images 2D FT is commonly used, and for transforming the image back into spatial domain Inverse Fourier Transform can be applied.

## Spectrum, Phase

## Which type of noise can be detected, filtered?
