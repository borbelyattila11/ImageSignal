# Music Compression
Music compression refers to reducing the amount of data required to store or transmit audio signals while preserving much of the perceived quality as possible.

## MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group)
MPEG is a working group that develops standards for audio and video compression. Most common standards for audio:
1. MPEG-1 Audio Layer III (MP3): Lossy audio compression format designed to reduce file size while maintaining audio quality.
2. MPEG-4: More advanced standard that includes AAC (Advanced Audio Coding), which offers better quality at similiar bitrates compared to MP3.

### MP3
Achieves significant reduction in file size by discarding audio data that is considered less perceptible to the human hearing. Allows variable bitrates, ranging 32 kpbs to 320 kpbs providing trade-off between file size and quality. Higher bitrates generally yield better audio quality at the cost of larger file sizes. Efficient in compressing audio, reducing typical CD-quality 16bit 44.1kHz stereo audio track to around one-tenth of its original size. Uses a psychoacoustic model to remove sounds that are less audible to the human ear, such as quiet sounds that occur simultaneously with louder sounds or high-frequency components that are difficult for the human ear to perceive.
